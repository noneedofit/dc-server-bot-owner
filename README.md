## Create a server

In the `index.js` file, edit the `server_name` field into whatever you want the name of the server to be.

- Note: copy the guild id you get in the console, to later on create a invite using it.

## Invite link

Now, open the `invite.js` file and change the `guild_id` (is written in two places, make sure to change both) in the brackets to your actual guild id. 
Run it to get the invite link in the console.
